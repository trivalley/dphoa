From the Association's perspective, a swimming pool can add to the value of the residences and attract prospective buyers. It's also seen as an amenity that can bring the residents of a community together; a gathering place where people can  meet, relax, and socialize.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, managing and maintaining our swimming pool is a major investment in time, energy and money. In order for our pool to be safe, successful, and enjoyable, we must address many issues including liability, usage regulations and maintenance. Proper management is the key to retaining our pool's value and reducing our liabilities.</p><p><br></p><p>A common problem that all HOAâ€™s have is controlling the use of their facilities by non-members, which can lead to vandalism and or increased liabilities. An obvious loss of control is when someone jumps the fence, but there is another less obvious problem that occurs. That problem is the access to the facilities with the use of unauthorized keys. When people sell their homes, or renters with keys move, the keys are not always accounted for. Some associations have reported that keys are  sometimes sold or given to friends inside as well as outside their neighborhood. To combat the unauthorized key problem and regain control, associations must re-key their facilities from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In order to start fresh and protect the investment in our newly remodeled pool facility, we  are in the process of re-keying and issuing new keys to our owners. We have also initiated a new policy that should minimize the access to our facility with the use of unauthorized keys. The new keys will be numbered. Each owner will be given one key only. More than one key per home will not be allowed. In the event that a key is lost or stolen, a progressive fee schedule has been instituted. The numbered key that is missing will be placed on a list. Pool monitors will check keys at the entry gate and confiscate any key that is on the list. Sellers  will also be reminded during escrow to transfer their key to the buyer to avoid fees.</p><p><br></p><p>We hope that our homeowners will appreciate the need to have a strong key policy and will fully and happily comply with it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Enjoy!</p></div>
